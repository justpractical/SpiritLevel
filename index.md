## Spirit Level and Angle Finder
#### Another Just Practical App


The Spirit Level is designed for use in taking angle measurements and for setting target angles.
It has an audio signaling system built in to enable to you hit level or any other angle without needing to be able to see the screen


### User Guide
The Spirit level is designed to allow users to easily find level. The integrated audio alerts system allows you to find level without needing to be able to see the scree. The frequency of beeps increases as you approach your target angle until you are within your chosen tollerance. The pitch indicates the direction you need to move to reach your desired angle.

It is possible to set different target angles, for example if you are looking to set the level of a pitched roof at 20 degrees you can select the desired angle on the target page
