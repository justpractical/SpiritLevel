## Spirit Level and Angle Finder
### Another Just Practical App


The Spirit level is designed to allow users to easily find level. The integrated audio alerts system allows operation without needing to be able to see the screen. The frequency of beeps increases as you approach your target angle until you are within your chosen tollerance. The pitch indicates the direction you need to move to reach your desired angle.

### Key Benefits
- Measure to any angle not just level
- Audio Alerts to guide you to your target angle
- Calibration for both face up and face down operation (accounts for case)
- Measure the distance between two angles
- Delayed readings to give you time to get phone in position
- Accurate reading mode wont record until phone is stable
- Variable tollerance for hitting target angle

#### Setting a Target
<hr>
<table>
<tr>
<td style="width:40%">
<img src="/SpiritLevel/images/selectTargetOrRange.png" width=200px> </td>
<td> <p>
You can select between setting a target angle and measuring a range by swiping left and right on the lower half of the screen 

It is possible to set different target angles, for example if you are looking to set the level of a pitched roof at 20 degrees you can select the desired angle on the target page 

Use the measuring type selector to select type of measurement then hit the Target button to set your angles. You can always adjust the angles manually by hitting the + / - buttons next to the measurement

There are three different types of measurement, the camera takes and instant snapshot, the target will try to take a measurement but will only record when a stable reading is achieved, the timer will take a measurement after a countdown delay (you can change length of delay in main menu)

#### Toggling on Features

 <p>
Use the icon toggles to turn and off different features 
<ul> 
<li>Audio : turn on audio alerts as you approach your target angle </li>
<li>Pitch : Measure phone orientation along its length </li>
<li>Roll : Measure phone orientation along its width </li>
<li>Yaw: Measure phone rotation parallel to the ground </li>
<li>Data Overlay : Show current reading in an overlay </li>
</ul>
