## Spirit Level and Angle Finder
### Another Just Practical App


The Spirit level is designed to allow users to easily find level. The integrated audio alerts system allows operation without needing to be able to see the screen. The frequency of beeps increases as you approach your target angle until you are within your chosen tolerance. The pitch indicates the direction you need to move to reach your desired angle.

### Key Benefits
- Measure to any angle not just level
- Audio Alerts to guide you to your target angle
- Calibration for both face up and face down operation (Even when using a phone case)
- Measure the distance between two angles
- Delayed readings to give you time to get phone in position
- Accurate reading mode wont record until phone is stable
- Variable tolerance for hitting target angle

#### Setting a Target
<hr>
<table style="vertical-align:top;width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:40%;vertical-align:top">
<img src="https://justpractical.github.io/SpiritLevel/images/selectTargetOrRange.png" width=200px> </td>
<td style="width:60%;vertical-align:top">
<p>
You can select between setting a target angle and measuring a range by swiping left and right on the lower half of the screen 

<br><br>
It is possible to set different target angles, for example if you are looking to set the level of a pitched roof at 20 degrees you can select the desired angle on the target page 

<br><br>
Use the measuring type selector to select type of measurement then hit the Target button to set your angles. You can always adjust the angles manually by hitting the + / - buttons next to the measurement, to clear a target swipe up on the box you want to clear

There are three different types of measurement, the camera takes and instant snapshot, the target will try to take a measurement but will only record when a stable reading is achieved, the timer will take a measurement after a countdown delay (you can change length of delay in main menu)

When using the spirit level if you are within tolerance of your target angle the "air bubble" colour will change and the audio alerts will stop. When you are within 0.1 degrees of your target the whole of the vials colour will also change.

<br><br>
To set the tolerance you can make an adjustment in settings or drag up or down the tolerance selector as shown

#### Toggling on Features
<hr>
<table style="vertical-align:top;width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:20%;vertical-align:top">
<img src="https://justpractical.github.io/SpiritLevel/images/toggleIcons.png" height=200px> </td>
<td style="width:80%;vertical-align:top">
 <p>
Use the icon toggles to turn and off different features 
<ul> 
<li><b>Audio:</b> turn on audio alerts as you approach your target angle </li>
<li><b>Pitch:</b> Measure phone orientation along its length </li>
<li><b>Roll:</b> Measure phone orientation along its width </li>
<li><b>Yaw:</b> Measure phone rotation parallel to the ground </li>
<li><b>Data Overlay:</b> Show current reading in an overlay </li>
</ul>

#### Measuring Between Points
<hr>
<table style="vertical-align:top;width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:35%;vertical-align:top">
<img src="https://justpractical.github.io/SpiritLevel/images/rangeControls.png" height=100 width=200> 
</td>
<td style="width:65%;vertical-align:top">
 <p>
 In order to measure between two angles you can swipe across to the measuring page. 
 
<br><br>
The maximum tilt in any direction is constantly measured unless locked. Hitting reset will clear the currently measured range. Maximum values are shown in the data overlay at the edges of the vials. 

<br><br>
To measure between to specific points you should select how you would like to take a measurement then hit either P1 or P2 to take a record. The range will become locked as soon as you take the first measurement, allowing you to move the phone to a new location without worrying about moving beyond your target measurement

#### Calibration
<hr>
<table style="vertical-align:top;width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:45%;vertical-align:top">
<img src="https://justpractical.github.io/SpiritLevel/images/calibrate.png" width=200px> 
</td>
<td style="width:55%;vertical-align:top">
 <p>
Your iPhone is fairly accurate straight out of the box, but to get the best performance it is good to calibrate the pitch and roll axes.
<br><br>
In the preferences menu select > calibrate

<br><br>
from here here you calibrate both for use with face up and face down. This is particularly important if you are using a phone case as the face and back are unlikely to be perfectly flat.

<br><br>
Find a level surface, the more level the better. When calibrating a countdown measurement will be used to give you time to place the phone.

<br><br>
Once calibrated, remember to update the orientation you are using the phone in to ensure the correct calibration is used.
